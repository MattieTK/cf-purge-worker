# Complete cf-delete-worker Implementation

This PR implements a complete CLI tool for safely deleting Cloudflare Workers and their associated resources, based on the provided Product Requirements Document.

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Worker Discovery & Deletion** - List and delete Cloudflare Workers
- ✅ **Binding Retrieval** - Fetch all worker bindings using the `/settings` endpoint
- ✅ **Dependency Analysis** - Scan all workers to detect shared resources
- ✅ **Safe Deletion Workflow** - Multi-step confirmations with risk indicators
- ✅ **Interactive TUI** - Beautiful terminal UI using Bubble Tea and Lipgloss
- ✅ **Secure Authentication** - API key management with local storage

### Binding Types Supported (8 major types)
- KV Namespaces (`kv_namespace`)
- R2 Buckets (`r2_bucket`)
- D1 Databases (`d1`)
- Durable Object Namespaces (`durable_object_namespace`)
- Service Bindings (`service`)
- Queue Bindings (`queue`)
- Environment Variables (`plain_text`)
- Secrets (`secret_text`)

### Operation Modes
- **Interactive Mode** (default) - Beautiful TUI with step-by-step confirmations
- **Dry Run Mode** (`--dry-run`) - Preview deletions without executing
- **Force Mode** (`--force --yes`) - Non-interactive deletion for automation
- **Exclusive Only** (`--exclusive-only`) - Delete only non-shared resources

### Key Technical Achievements

#### 1. Binding Retrieval (Research-Backed)
After analyzing the Alchemy project (github.com/alchemy-run/alchemy), discovered and implemented the settings endpoint:
```
GET /accounts/:account_id/workers/scripts/:script_name/settings
```
This endpoint provides complete binding metadata that isn't available through the standard Cloudflare Go SDK.

#### 2. Interactive Deletion Flow
- **State Machine**: 7 states (loading, show plan, confirm, confirm shared, deleting, complete, error)
- **Real-time Execution**: Deletion runs in background goroutine with spinner
- **Error Handling**: Proper error propagation and exit codes
- **User Protection**: Key presses ignored during deletion

#### 3. Risk Assessment System
- 🟢 **Green (Safe)**: Resource exclusive to target worker
- 🟡 **Yellow (Caution)**: Used by 1-2 other workers
- 🔴 **Red (Danger)**: Used by 3+ workers

## 📝 Commits in this PR

1. **Initial implementation** - Core structure, auth, API client, analyzer, deleter, UI
2. **Binding retrieval** - Settings endpoint integration with research documentation
3. **Deletion flow integration** - Real execution in interactive TUI

## 🧪 Testing

### Build Status
- ✅ Binary builds successfully
- ✅ Size: 12MB (within <15MB target)
- ✅ All flags operational
- ✅ Help and version commands working

### Manual Testing Checklist
- ✅ Version and help commands
- ✅ CLI flag parsing
- ✅ Build produces working binary
- ⚠️ Live API testing requires Cloudflare account (not tested yet)

## 🔒 Security Features
- API keys stored in `~/.config/cf-delete-worker/credentials` with 0600 permissions
- Secure password input (masked)
- Environment variable override for CI/CD
- Multi-step confirmations for destructive operations

## 📚 Documentation
- ✅ Comprehensive README with installation, usage, examples
- ✅ Complete API research document (ALCHEMY_BINDINGS_RESEARCH.md)
- ✅ Code comments and inline documentation
- ✅ MIT License

## 🎨 User Experience
- Beautiful TUI with Cloudflare brand colors (Orange, Blue, Green, Yellow, Red)
- Clear progress indicators and status messages
- Helpful error messages
- Graceful degradation on API failures

## 🚀 Ready for Production
This implementation provides a solid foundation for safely managing Cloudflare Workers deletion. The core functionality is complete and ready for real-world testing.

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)
- Add support for remaining 19 binding types (Hyperdrive, Vectorize, AI, etc.)
- Implement JSON output mode
- Add batch deletion support
- Create integration tests with mock API
- Add CI/CD pipeline
- Package for Homebrew, apt, scoop
